# Arch-Fundamentals-SOLID

This repository is dedicated to exploring the SOLID principles of object-oriented design. It contains practical code examples and detailed explanations to demonstrate how these principles can be applied to create robust, maintainable, and scalable software architectures.

## Contents

- [Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):](./solid/1-S-SRP.md)Examples showing how to keep classes focused on a single responsibility.
- [Open/Closed Principle (OCP):](./solid/2-O-OCP.md) Code illustrating how to design systems that are open for extension but closed for modification.
- [Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):](./solid/3-L-LSP.md) Demonstrations of substitutable subclasses that adhere to the behavior of their base classes.
- [Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):](./solid/4-I-ISP.md) Examples where clients are not forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
- [Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):](./solid/5-D-DIP.md) Code showing the importance of high-level modules not depending on low-level modules but on abstractions.

Each principle is illustrated with clear, concise code in multiple programming languages, along with commentary on best practices and potential pitfalls. This repository serves as a foundational resource for anyone looking to master SOLID principles and improve their software architecture skills.

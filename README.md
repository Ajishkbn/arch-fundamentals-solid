# Arch-Fundamentals-SOLID

This repository is dedicated to exploring the SOLID principles of object-oriented design. It contains practical code examples and detailed explanations to demonstrate how these principles can be applied to create robust, maintainable, and scalable software architectures.

## Contents:
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Examples showing how to keep classes focused on a single responsibility.
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** Code illustrating how to design systems that are open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Demonstrations of substitutable subclasses that adhere to the behavior of their base classes.
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** Examples where clients are not forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** Code showing the importance of high-level modules not depending on low-level modules but on abstractions.

Each principle is illustrated with clear, concise code in multiple programming languages, along with commentary on best practices and potential pitfalls. This repository serves as a foundational resource for anyone looking to master SOLID principles and improve their software architecture skills.
